# WhereIsMyCoffee

If you often lose your coffee while walking around home or the office, this is for you.

You'll need an HC-SR04, a motor, a L298N motor driver, an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, some wires, and a bit of creativity.

Lift the coffee mug, and the motor spins a noisy toy (mine's a LEGO set). Put the mug back, and it stops going wild.
